This directory is called `unit_tests_real/` because I misnamed tests originally. What's currently called `unit_tests/` are actually integration tests, and what's called `integration_tests/` are actually e2e tests. When I rename those, I'll change the name of this dir to `unit_tests/`.

I originally thought of unit tests as "anything that doesn't require a network call." Naming things is hard. :/
