***** Deployments to platform.sh are experimental at this point ***

- Support for deploying to platform.sh is in an exploratory phase at this point.
- You should only be using this project to deploy to platform.sh at this point if
  you are interested in helping to develop or test the simple_deploy project.
- You should look at the deploy_platformsh.py script before running this command,
  so you know what kinds of changes will be made to your project.
- You should understand the platform.sh console, and be comfortable deleting resources
  that are created during this deployment.
- You may want to cancel this run and deploy to a different platform.
"""

confirm_automate_all = """
The --automate-all flag means simple_deploy will:
- Run `platform create` for you, to create an empty Platform.sh project.
  - This will create a project in the us-3.platform.sh region. If you wish
    to use a different region, cancel this operation and use the --region flag.
  - You can see a list of all regions by running `platform help project:create`
- Commit all changes to your project that are necessary for deployment.
- Push these changes to Platform.sh.
- Open your deployed project in a new browser tab.

In order to deploy to Platform.sh, you need to install the Platform.sh CLI.
  See here: https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/introduction/template/cli-requirements.html
After installing the CLI, you can run simple_deploy again.
"""

In order to deploy to Platform.sh, you need to install the package `platformshoconfig`.
To do this, run the following command, or its equivalent in your project:
    pip install platformshconfig
After installing this package, you can run simple_deploy again.

no_project_name = """
A Platform.sh project name could not be found.

The simple_deploy command expects that you've already run `platform create`, or
associated the local project with an existing project on Platform.sh.

If you haven't done so, run the `platform create` command and then run
simple_deploy again. You can override this warning by using
the `--deployed-project-name` flag to specify the name you want to use for the
project. This must match the name of your Platform.sh project.
"""

org_not_found = """
A Platform.sh organization name could not be found.

You may have created a Platform.sh account, but not created an organization.
The Platform.sh CLI requires an organization name when creating a new project.

Please visit the Platform.sh console and make sure you have created an organization.
You can also do this through the CLI using the `platform organization:create` command.
For help, run `platform help organization:create`.

You appear to be logged out of the Platform.sh CLI. Please run the

You may want to re-run simple_deploy without the --automate-all flag.

        While running `platform create`, an error has occurred. You should check
        the Platform.sh console to see if a project was partially created.

        The error messages that Platform.sh provides, both through the CLI and
        the console, are not always specific enough to be helpful. For example, 
        newer users are limited to two new projects in a 24-hour period, or something
        like that. But if you try to create an additional project, you only get
        a message that says: "You do not have access to create a new Subscriptions resource".
        There is no information about specific limits, and how to address them.
