***** Support for Fly.io is in the preliminary phase ***

- Support for deploying to Fly.io is in the preliminary phase at this point.
- You should only be using this project to deploy to Fly.io at this point if
  you are interested in helping to develop or test the simple_deploy project.
- You should look at the deploy_flyio.py script before running this command,
  so you know what kinds of changes will be made to your project.
- You should understand the Fly.io console, and be comfortable deleting resources
  that are created during this deployment.
- You may want to cancel this run and deploy to a different platform.

The --automate-all flag means simple_deploy will:
- Run `fly apps create` for you, to create an empty Fly.io project.
- Run `fly postgres create`, to create a new database for your project.
- Configure your project for deployment on Fly.io.
- Commit all changes to your project that are necessary for deployment.
