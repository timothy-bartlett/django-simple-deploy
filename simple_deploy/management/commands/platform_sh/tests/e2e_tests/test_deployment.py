    Note: On Windows, this must be run from a bash terminal, such as Git Bash,
        or through WSL.
      On Windows you may see a popup about authenticating an RSA key fingerprint. Sometimes this
        is hidden by a console window. Look for that confirmation if a platform command
        hangs. Enter 'yes' (not just 'y') into that box if it appears. It obscures what 
        you type with asterisks, but it's just looking for 'yes'.
      Confirming the RSA key in the popup generates a `.ssh/known_hosts` file, which then allows
        you to use non-bash shells. That behavior is *really* confusing, though. I don't think the
        platform.sh CLI was designed to be used on native Windows at all. :/
      Also, sometimes helps to run `platform auth:logout` followed by `platform auth:browser-login`.
