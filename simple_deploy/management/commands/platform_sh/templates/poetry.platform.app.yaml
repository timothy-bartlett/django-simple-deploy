# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.

# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed

hooks:
  # The build hook runs before the application is deployed, and is useful for

  # DEV: Why remove logs right after making them?
  #      Also, may want to split requirements into requirements.txt and requirements_remote.txt.
