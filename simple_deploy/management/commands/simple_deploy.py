"""Handles all platform-agnostic aspects of the deployment process."""

# This is the command that's called to automate deployment.
# - It starts the process, and then dispatches to platform-specific helpers.
# - Some of the steps that are platform-agnostic are in this file (at least for now),
#   but are called by the helpers.
# - Each helper gets a reference to this command object.
