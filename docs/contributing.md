Contributing
===

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. :)

There are a number of ways you can get started:
- Try using django-simple-deploy on a project you've written, and see what works well and what doesn't work well. What questions, problems, or ideas did you have as you started to use the project? Please open an issue and share what you found.
- Try downloading or cloning the project and [running the tests](../integration_tests/README.md). You'll see a sample blog project deployed to Heroku in a fully automated process.
- Open an issue or a discussion and share why you're interested in this project, and ask for a way to help.
