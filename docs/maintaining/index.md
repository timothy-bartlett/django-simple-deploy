title: 'Maintaining'

Maintaining a project is distinct from contributing to a project. A maintainer merges PRs and manages issues and discussions. There are some tasks and ideas that need to be documented so that these things are done appropriately, consistently, and transparently.

Currently, there is only one maintainer of this project. I will be looking to build a small group of maintainers, as my long-term goal is for this to become a project that belongs to the community.
