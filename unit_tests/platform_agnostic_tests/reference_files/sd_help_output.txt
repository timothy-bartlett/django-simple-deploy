Customize simple_deploy's behavior:
  --automate-all        Automates all aspects of deployment. Creates
                        resources, makes commits, and runs `push` or `deploy`
                        commands.
  --no-logging          Do not create a log of the configuration and
                        deployment process.
  --ignore-unclean-git  Run simple_deploy even with an unclean `git status`
                        message.

Customize deployment configuration:
  --deployed-project-name DEPLOYED_PROJECT_NAME
                        Provide a name that the platform will use for this
                        project.
  --region REGION       Specify the region that this project will be deployed
                        to.
